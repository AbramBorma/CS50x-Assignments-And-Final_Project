Q1: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer:
I guess each Audio Aura is governed by a single or more elements from songs table, for example:

- Purple would affected by all the elements.
- Green would be affected by Key and Valence.
- Pink would be affected by Speechiness.
- Orange would be affected by Energy, Loudness, Tempo, Danceability & Valence
- Yellow would be affected by Energy, Key & Valence.
- Blue would be affected by Speechiness and Valence.

Q2: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Answer:
I really believe that an equation of some factors multiplied by the value of each element would create an accurate Aura.
